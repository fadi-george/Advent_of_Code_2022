# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 (Typescript)

My attempt at this year's advent of code.

## Running

Run the script solve with some day argument e.g.:

```
npm run solve -- --day=1
```

or

cd into a day\_ folder and run w/ `ts-node` or `bun js` e.g.

```
bun part_1.ts
```

[bunjs](https://bun.sh/) is a quick and easy way to run ts files.

You can replace the input.txt with your own custom input.
